# Roadmap

The roadmap is really just a place where I collect 'I should do this...' items. No priority yet, but eventually I'll start outlining how I want to approach these better. Most of the roadmap is dictated by my own personal usage of the package, but I'm open to suggestions/proddings/pleadings otherwise ;-)

* Unit test improvements - I suck at unit tests
* Class properties to return parameters cleanly
* Class properties to return smoothed state cleanly
* Input parsing (I.E. idiot-proofing)
* Gussy up the `plot_fit` chart
* Seasonality? Maybe?
